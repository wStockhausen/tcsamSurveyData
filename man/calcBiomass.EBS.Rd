\value{
data frame with columns: \cr \itemize{ \item YEAR = survey
year \item other user-defined factors (e.g., sex,
shell_condition) \item numStations = number of stations
included \item numHauls = number of hauls included \item
numIndivs = number of individuals sampled \item TOT_AREA =
total area included in strata \item totABUNDANCE = total
abundance estimate \item stdABUNDANCE = std deviation of
total abundance estimate \item cvABUNDANCE = cv of total
abundance estimate \item totBIOMASS = estimate of total
biomass estimate \item stdBIOMASS = std deviation of total
biomass estimate \item cvBIOMASS = cv of total biomass

\description{
This function calculates total abundance and biomass from a
by-stratum data frame or csv file.
}
\details{


If \code{tbl} and \code{in.csv} are both NULL, the user is
prompted to enter a csv file with biomass by stratum info.
\cr \cr Notes: \cr \itemize{ \item Area is in square
nautical miles \item Abundance is in 10^6 individuals \item
Biomass is in 10^3 mt }
}
