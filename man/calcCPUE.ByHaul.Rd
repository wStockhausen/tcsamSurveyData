\value{
A dataframe of cpue (numbers and weight) by haul. See Details.
}
\description{
Function to calculate cpue by survey haul and other factors (e.g., sex) from station, haul and individual crab info.
}
\details{
Note: tbl_hauls is required. if tbl_indivs is a dataframe, it is used. If it is a character vector, it is
interpreted as a file name and it is read as a csv file. If it is NULL, the user is prompted to choose a file
to read. \cr
The returned dataframe has the following columns: \cr
\itemize{
\item   YEAR
\item   STRATUM
\item   GIS_STATION
\item   HAULJOIN
\item   LONGITUDE
\item   LATITUDE
\item   SEX
\item   MATURITY
\item   SHELL_CONDITION
\item   SIZE
\item   numIndivs
\item   SAMPLING_FACTOR
\item   AREA_SWEPT_VARIABLE
\item   numCPUE
\item   wgtCPUE
}
\cr Other notes: \cr
\itemize{
\item   AREA_SWEPT_VARIABLE is in sq. nm.
\item   CPUE in numbers is in no/(sq. nm.)
\item   CPUE in weight  is in mt/(sq. nm.)
} \cr
}
