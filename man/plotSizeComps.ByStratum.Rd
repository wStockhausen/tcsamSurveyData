\description{
Function to plot time series of aggregated catch data.
}
\details{


The time series for each factor level combination is plotted
separately. Distinct levels of each factor can be dropped from the
final plot by seting dropLevels to a list with names corresponding to
factor columns and values being vectors of factor levels to drop.

One plot is created for each distinct level of 'STRATUM'.
