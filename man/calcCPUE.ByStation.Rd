\arguments{
\item{tbl_strata}{: dataframe w/ station info}

\item{tbl_cpue}{: data frame w/ cpue by haul from call to calcCPUE.ByHaul(...), or name of csv file w/ cpue by haul, or NULL to choose file}

\item{export}{: boolean flag to write results to csv file}

\item{out.csv}{: output file name}

\item{out.dir}{: output file directory}

\item{verbosity}{: integer flag indicating level of printed output (0=off,1=minimal,2=full)}
}
\value{
A dataframe of cpue (numbers and weight) by year, stratum, survey station
and other factors. Only stations where hauls were conducted are returned. See Details for dataframe structure.

\details{
Notes: \cr
\itemize{
\item   CPUE in numbers is in no/(sq. nm.) \cr
\item   CPUE in weight  is in mt/(sq. nm.) \cr
\item   CPUE is calculated only for stations at which at least 1 haul was conducted
} \cr
The returned dataframe has the following columns: \cr
\itemize{
\item   YEAR
\item   STRATUM
\item   GIS_STATION
\item   HAULJOIN
\item   LONGITUDE
\item   LATITUDE
\item   SEX
\item   MATURITY
\item   SHELL_CONDITION
\item   SIZE
\item   numHauls
\item   numNonZeroHauls
\item   numIndivs
\item   SAMPLING_FACTOR
\item   AREA_SWEPT_VARIABLE
\item   numCPUE
\item   wgtCPUE
