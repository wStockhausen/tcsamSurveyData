\title{Function to calculate cpue by survey station, averaging over cpue by haul.}
\usage{
calcCPUE.ByStation(tbl_strata = NULL, tbl_cpue = NULL, export = FALSE,
  out.csv = "cpue.ByStation.csv", out.dir = NULL, verbosity = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl_strata}{: dataframe w/ station info}

\item{tbl_cpue}{: data frame w/ cpue by haul from call to calcCPUE.ByHaul(...), or name of csv file w/ cpue by haul, or NULL to choose file}

\item{export}{: boolean flag to write results to csv file}

\item{out.csv}{: output file name}

\item{out.dir}{: output file directory}

\item{verbosity}{: integer flag indicating level of printed output (0=off,1=minimal,2=full)}
}
\value{
A dataframe of cpue (numbers and weight) by year, stratum, survey station 
and other factors with the following columns. See Details.

}
\details{
Notes: \cr
\itemize{
\item   CPUE in numbers is in no/(sq. nm.) \cr
\item   CPUE in weight  is in mt/(sq. nm.) \cr
\item   CPUE is calculated only for stations at which at least 1 haul was conducted
} \cr
The returned dataframe has the following columns: \cr
\itemize{
\item   YEAR
\item   STRATUM
\item   GIS_STATION
\item   HAULJOIN
\item   LONGITUDE
\item   LATITUDE
\item   requested factors, if any
\item   numHauls
\item   numNonZeroHauls
\item   numIndivs
\item   numCPUE
\item   wgtCPUE
}
