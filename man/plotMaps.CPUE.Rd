\arguments{
\item{tbl_cpue}{: dataframe from call to \code{\link{calcCPUE.ByHaul}} or \code{\link{calcCPUE.ByStation}} (or crab cpue filename, or NULL)}

\item{years}{: vector of survey years for which to produce maps}

\item{ztype}{: the data type (numCPUE, wgtCPUE to map)}

\item{scaleBy}{: factor to scale the ztype by BEFORE sending to plotMap.CSV}

\item{zlab}{: label for z (cpue) axes on map}

\item{zunits}{: label for z (cpue) units on maps}

\item{zscl}{: see Details}

\item{basename}{: base name for output files (year and factor level combinations will be added)}

\item{verbosity}{: integer flag indicating level of printed output (0=off,1=minimal,2=full)}
}
\value{
the max zscale, or a named list (names corresponding to individual factor combinations)
of max zscales that were used for plots. This value can be used to scale all maps 
(if a single numeric value) or maps corresponding to a given factor combination (if
a named list) when running the function on the same cpue values a second time.
}
\description{
Function to map cpue by survey haul or station and other factors (e.g., sex) from cpue info.
}
\details{
Needs to filled in. \cr
Note: Multiple values at the same location will be summed prior to being mapped.
\cr
Note: zscl can be NULL, a numeric value, or a named list with numeric values as 
list elements. If NULL, then the max z value for the data plotted on an individual
map will be used to scale that map. If a numeric value, then it is used as the 
z-axis scale for all maps produced. If a named list, the element corresponding to 
each combination of factors will be used as the z-axis scale for that set of maps.
