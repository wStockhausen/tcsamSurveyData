\value{
Dataframe w/ estimates of abundance, biomass by year, strata as east/west of 166W, and other factors. Columns are \cr
\itemize{
\item  YEAR            = survey year
\item  STRATUM         = 'EAST' or 'WEST' of 166W
\item  STRATUM_AREA    = area of stratum
\item  other user-defined factors (e.g., sex, shell_condition)
\item  numStations     = number of stations included
\item  numHauls        = number of hauls included
\item  numNonZeroHauls = number of hauls included
\item  numIndivs       = number of individuals sampled
\item  totABUNDANCE    = estimated abundance
\item  stdABUNDANCE    = std deviation of estimated abundance
\item  cvABUNDANCE     = cv of estiamted abundance
\item  totBIOMASS      = estimated biomass
\item  stdBIOMASS      = std deviation of estimated biomass
\item  cvBIOMASS       = cv of estimated biomass

\description{
This function estimates abundance, biomass by year, east/west of 166W from a biomass-by-stratum data frame or csv file.
}
\details{
Note: if tbl and in.csv are both NULL, the user is prompted to enter a csv file with biomass by stratum info. \cr
Notes: \cr
\itemize{
\item   Area is in square nautical miles
\item   Abundance is in 10^6 individuals
\item   Biomass   is in 10^3 mt
}
