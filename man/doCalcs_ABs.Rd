\item{aggBySex}{- flag to agregate CPUE over sexes}

\item{aggByMaturity}{- flag to aggregate of maturity states}

\item{aggByShellCondition}{- flag to aggregate over shell conditions}

\item{dropLevels}{- NULL, or list (by factor name) of vectors of factor values to drop (see help for \code{wtsUtilities::dropLevels})}

\value{
a nested list with elements cpue and ABs. \code{cpue} has the following elements: \cr
\itemize{
\item {byHaul}     {- data frame of cpue (numbers and weight) by year, haul and other factor levels}
\item {byStratum}     {- data frame of cpue (numbers and weight) by year, station and other factor levels (or NULL)}
} \cr
\code{ABs} has the following elements: \cr
\itemize{
\item {byStratum} {- data frame with abundance, biomass by year, stratum and other factor levels}
\item {EW166}     {- data frame with abundance, biomass by year, EW166 split and other factor levels (optional)}
\item {EBS}       {- data frame with abundance, biomass by year and other factor levels for the EBS}
}

\details{
Notes: \itemize{
  \item CPUE in numbers is in no/(sq. nm.)
  \item CPUE in weight  is in mt/(sq. nm.)
  \item Abundance is in 10^6 individuals
  \item Biomass   is in 10^3 mt
