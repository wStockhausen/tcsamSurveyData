Dataframe w/ estimates of abundance, size comps size comps by year, strata as east/west of 166W, and other factors. Columns are \cr
\itemize{
\item  YEAR            = survey year
\item  STRATUM         = 'EAST' or 'WEST' of 166W
\item  STRATUM_AREA    = area of stratum
\item  other user-defined factors (e.g., sex, shell_condition)
\item  SIZE
\item  numStations     = number of stations included
\item  numHauls        = number of hauls included
\item  numNonZeroHauls = number of hauls included
\item  numIndivs       = number of individuals sampled

\description{
This function estimates size comps for abundance, size comps by year, east/west of 166W from a size comps-by-stratum data frame or csv file.
}
\details{
Note: if tbl and in.csv are both NULL, the user is prompted to enter a csv file with size comps by stratum info. \cr
Notes: \cr
\itemize{
\item   Area is in square nautical miles
\item   Abundance is in 10^6 individuals
\item   Biomass   is in 10^3 mt
}
