\title{Calculate EBS-level size comps (abundance and biomass) from a by-stratum data frame or csv file.}
\usage{
calcSizeComps.EBS(tbl = NULL, in.csv = NULL, export = TRUE,
  out.csv = "SurveySizeComps.EBS.csv", out.dir = NULL, verbosity = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl}{: data frame with size comps by stratum info from call to \code{\link{calcSizeComps.ByStratum} or \link{calcSizeComps.EW166}}, or a csv file from such a call, or NULL}

\item{export}{: boolean flag to write results to csv file}

\item{out.csv}{: output file name}

\item{out.dir}{: output file directory}

\item{verbosity}{: integer flag indicating level of printed output (0=off,1=minimal,2=full)}
}
\value{
data frame with columns: \cr
\itemize{
\item  YEAR = survey year
\item  STRATUM         = 'EBS'
\item  STRATUM_AREA    = area of stratum
\item  other user-defined factors (e.g., sex, shell_condition)
\item  SIZE
\item  numStations     = number of stations included
\item  numHauls        = number of hauls included
\item  numNonZeroHauls = number of hauls included
\item  numIndivs       = number of individuals sampled
\item  totABUNDANCE = total abundance-by-size estimate
\item  totBIOMASS = estimate of total biomass-by-size estimate
}
}
\description{
This function calculates total abundance and biomass from a by-stratum data frame or csv file.
}
\details{


If \code{tbl} and \code{in.csv} are both NULL, the user is prompted to enter a csv file with biomass by stratum info. \cr
\cr Notes: \cr
\itemize{
\item   Area is in square nautical miles
\item   Abundance is in 10^6 individuals
\item   Biomass   is in 10^3 mt
}
